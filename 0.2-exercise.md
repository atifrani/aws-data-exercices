# Exercise 01

This exercise aim to automate the loadinf of the files from AWS s3 to AWS RDS using AWS lambda.

## Lambda Loader
deploy python application with AWS lambda


## Create IAM Role
You start with creation of the IAM role which AWS Lambda function uses for the authorization to call other AWS Services.

1. Login to the AWS Console. Select Ireland as the region.
2. Goto the IAM Management console and click on the Roles menu in the left and then click on the Create role button.
3. On the next screen, select Lambda as the service and click on the Next: Permissions button.
4. On the next screen, select "AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole", "AmazonRDSFullAccess" and AmazonS3FullAccess as the policy and click on the Next: Tags button.
5. On the next screen, click on the Next: Review button.
6. On the next screen, type in "lambda_s3_rds" for the Role name and click on the Create role button.
7. The role is created in no time. The next step is to create the lambda function.


## Create Lambda loader
You create the Lambda Function to laod csv files from s3 to rds.

1. In the Lambda Console, click on the Functions menu in the left and then click on the Create function button
2. On the next screen, select Author from scratch as the option. Type in "lambda_loader" as the name. 
   Select Python 3.8 as the runtime. Select Use an existing role as the option for the execution role and select aws_lambda_rds for the role.
   Finally, click on the Create function button.
3. The function is created in no time. You will configure Lambda function using code provided with this workshop. Download the project code https://github.com/atifrani/lambda_loader from github repository.
4. Import the zip code into your lambda fucntion by clicking on the "Upload from" button and then click on the .zip file option.
5. Add lambda layer,  go to Layers section, click on "add a layer" buttom, select "Specify an ARN". finally add this two layers "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:898466741470:layer:psycopg2-py38:1"  
6. The Lambda function is ready. Letâ€™s now configure the database storage.


## Create Postgresql Table 

You create a postgresql tables.

1. Connect to your postgresql database using BDEAVER.
2. Open a new sql editor and execute the sql queries to create tables.
3. Check if the table exist by runing this quesry "select * from tables"
4. Go to the lambda code and update ther database informations.
